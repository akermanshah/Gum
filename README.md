The following are the links to pictures of gum, as well as the text for each image

    a. Although it is not gum, altoids mints provide a minty, breath freshening alternative to gum. If you need gum solely for the purpose of ridding the aftertaste of that burrito you just got from chipotle, this is exactly what you need. Altoids are less expensive per piece, don't need to be chewed, and slowly dissolve, making them a worthy alternative to traditional gum.

The following are the links to pictures of gum, as well as the text for each image

    a. Although it is not gum, altoids mints provide a minty, breath freshening alternative to gum. If you need gum solely for the purpose of ridding the aftertaste of that burrito you just got from chipotle, this is exactly what you need. Altoids are less expensive per piece, don't need to be chewed, and slowly dissolve, making them a worthy alternative to traditional gum.

    a. Stride gum perfectly combines a flavorful and long-lasting gum with unique packaging. Thanks to their edible wrappers and magnetic packages, this gum really stands out from the pack. Many flavors are available, but we recommend sweet berry and forever fruit.
  3. dubble bubble: <a href="http://imgur.com/uAswamg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uAswamg.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
    a. If you need gum for blowing bubbles, dubble bubble is the way to go. The durable texture and low sugar content allow you to focus on your bubble blowing technique. A classic.
  4. trident minty: <a href="http://imgur.com/C4VGsOS"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C4VGsOS.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
    a. Thanks to a sugar alchohol known as xylitol, trident gum is not only good for your taste buds, but for your teeth as well. The agent fights bacteria in the mouth, clearing away bad breath and decreasing the likelihood of cavitities. Minty flavors include spearmint, wintergreen, and original.
  5. trident layers: <a href="http://imgur.com/kLghMUy"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kLghMUy.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
    a. One of our personal favorites, trident layers is well designed, healthy, and incredibly flavorful. Although it may not last as long as some other flavors, the gum includes a sugar alchohol known as xylitol in its ingredients. Xylitol fights bacteria to freshen your breath and decrease the risk of cavities. Our favorite flavors include apple pineapple, strawberry citrus, and cherry lime.
